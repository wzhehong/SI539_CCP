                <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three
                    different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the
                    neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the
                    embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
                <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
                    energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his
                    toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

                <p>Sprout, a shy and elusive kitten when he first arrived at four months old, gradually became an
                    affectionate companion. He enjoyed sleeping on my bed, but his early morning wake-up calls at 6:30
                    AM were a daily routine.</p>
                <p>During my challenging academic phase, Sprout became my constant companion during late-night drawing
                    sessions, quietly curling up on my lap, providing comfort and banishing solitude.</p>

                <p>Rocket (also named huihui) is a 6-month pomeranian puppy with big eyes and a small, black cute nose.
                    Rocket is named rocket because he runs so fast and energetic all day without even having some rest.
                    Rocket loves to carry his little toy walking around the house and jumping towards my bed.</p>
                <p>Rocket is friendly to all human beings. He will be a little shy at first, but will 'say hi' to you
                    after a few seconds. He is also friendly to dogs, especially the small breed, because the large size
                    dogs are hard for him to smell lol. If you meet rocket, don't hesitate to say hi to him!! He will be
                    super happy the whole day.</p>
